# Mushroom Classification Challenge

This GitHub repository is a course challenge where we trained a machine learning model to recognize three types of mushrooms: **Amanita**, **Crimini**, and **Oyster**. It includes a Jupyter notebook for training the model and a dataset of approximately 15,000 images for training.
